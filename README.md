# IRIE
IRIE (Ivan Ristić Improved ETA) is a numerical weather prediction model, developed from previous models that have their roots in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia. In the 70s of the 20th century, the first modern computer code for solving atmospheric motion equations (Limited Area Primitive Equation Model - LAPEM) was written by Fedor Messinger and Zavisa Janjić. A period of improvement followed and the Hydrometeorological Institute and Belgrade University model (HIBU) was created, and then the highly regarded ETA model. ETA model became officially operational at NCEP on 8 June 1993.
At the end of the 20th century, the development of the IRIE model, based on the basic equations of the ETA model, began. Over the next 20 years, work on improving the IRIE model was almost daily with real-time feedback from meteorologists and continuous support from Antonio Sanò (iLMeteo-Italy) and Jesper Thiesen (ConWX-Denmark).
It was necessary to reach the quality of the official models, which were worked on by large teams of scientists and programmers. IRIE model followed all the latest scientific developments, as reported by its successful users such as iLMeteo, ConWX, EMD, Femax, Weathernews and Vestas. As part of the development of the IRIE model, the most significant achievements are related to clouds and precipitation, i.e. cloud microphysics and convection.
